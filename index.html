                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This project involves developing an Android application for learning and testing the Semaphore flag signaling system, where different flag positions represent letters of the alphabet. The app is designed with two key sections: Learn and Practice. In the Learn section, users are introduced to grouped letters with clear visual representations of each flag signal. The Practice section allows users to quickly review all letters from A to Z. A 20-question quiz helps reinforce learning by providing instant feedback on user answers, along with a final score and percentage. The outcome highlights how an interactive mobile platform can make learning semaphore both effective and enjoyable, combining visual aids with active testing to boost user engagement and retention.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p> This project simulates a real-time landslide detection and alert system using NS-3 with Wi-Fi-enabled sensor nodes. These nodes are placed in a mountainous area to monitor conditions and send alerts to city-based nodes when a landslide is detected. The simulation uses Wi-Fi communication along with mobility and network models to reflect realistic scenarios, such as node movement and data routing during a disaster. The outcome shows that wireless sensor networks can enable fast and reliable communication in emergencies, making them suitable for early warning systems in both remote and urban areas.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p> This project simulates a Theater Management System using Database Management System (DBMS) concepts. It handles key operations such as managing movies, showtimes, seat availability, and user information. The system is built using SQL to perform tasks like inserting new movie records, updating show schedules, tracking available seats, and processing user bookings. Users can browse movies and book tickets, while administrators have control over movie listings, timing adjustments, and seat allocations. The outcome demonstrates how a well-structured relational database can efficiently manage real-time theater operations, ensuring smooth booking and scheduling for both users and administrators.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This project presents a smart IoT-based system for automating and monitoring terrace garden plants using sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller. It tackles common issues like irregular watering and environmental impact by using sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and sunlight levels. Based on sensor data, the system activates a water pump when needed and sends notifications to users via Bluetooth. The outcome demonstrates how IoT technology can improve water efficiency, enable real-time plant care, and reduce manual intervention, making terrace gardening more sustainable and user-friendly.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This project develops a Blockchain-Based Student Certificate Verification System using Ethereum smart contracts to securely issue, store, and verify academic certificates. It addresses the growing problem of document forgery and inefficiencies in manual verification by allowing universities to register certificates on a decentralized blockchain ledger. Employers and institutions can instantly verify certificate authenticity using a unique Certificate ID, eliminating the need for intermediaries. The system leverages blockchain’s transparency, immutability, and decentralization to ensure certificates are tamper-proof and easily verifiable in real-time. The outcome demonstrates how blockchain technology can enhance trust, reduce verification time and costs, and provide a secure, efficient solution for authenticating academic credentials in the education sector.</p>
